# Generate a YAML file for a GitHub Actions workflow to implement a staged build of ROS packages.
# This only ever needs to be run when changes need to be made to the build workflow.
# It is NOT invoked during the regular build process.
# Legit reasons to run this script are:
# - to change the number of build stages if longer dependency chains are introduced
# - change the number of workers per stage
# - include other changes to the build workflow in the script itself and regenerate the YAML file accordingly

import em

# Stages are defined by dependency levels.
# Each stage builds packages that depend only on packages from previous stages.
# This needs to be >= the maximum dependency level in the package set.
NR_OF_STAGES = 19

# GHA allows up to 20 parallel jobs per free account (not repository)
# The number of actually active workers per stage is further reduced by job assignment,
# so this specifies an upper limit.
MAXIMUM_NR_OF_WORKERS_PER_STAGE = 10
